##Train system

####This is a train system built using Ruby with SQL on the back end.

To use it, download the zip file and navigate to the file in your terminal. Then run `ruby trains.rb` to bring up the user interface.

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/train-system) was meant to introduce us to using SQL databases in our Ruby programs.
